## OOP with SLL
SQL is not designed with OOP in mind. However, the advantages of OOP can be \
synthsised with the following structure:

| OOP principle       | SLL equivalent                                   |
|---------------------|--------------------------------------------------|
| List of classes     | Schema (within relevant database, and label OOP) |
| Class               | Table (in OOP schema)                            |
| Instance            | Row (in class table)                             |
| Instance name       | Row ID (in class table)                          |
| Instance attributes | Row vales (in class table)                       |
| Arguments           | Row values                                       |
| Class inheritance   | Table inheritance                                |
| Class functions     | Function designed and named for class table      |
